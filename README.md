# Medical-Text-Classification

The goal of the project was to develop and compare a few classification models that would match the medical text to its closest medical specialty. The multiclass classification problem needed to be solved, meaning that physicians had to be classified into more than two categories. A private dataset of a company was preprocessed, cross-validated and different algorithms (Naive Bayes, SVM, LogisticRegression, simple Neutral Network and Transformer) were applied to find the model with the highest accuracy. The preprocessing phase involved cleaning the data, removing stop words, stemming and lemmatization.
